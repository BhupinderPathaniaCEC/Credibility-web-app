## ## 🧪 Unit Test Report (UTR)

### ### 🧪 Testing Strategy
The Credibility Index project implements a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure system reliability and code quality.
* **Backend Testing**: We utilize **xUnit/NUnit** for the **.NET 10.0 Web API** to verify Domain entities and Application use cases.
* **Frontend Testing**: We utilize **Karma/Jasmine** for the **Angular UI** (located in `ui/credibility-ui`) to ensure component stability.


### ### 🎯 Coverage Goals
To maintain project standards, we have established the following baseline for code quality:
* **Overall Coverage**: Aiming for **80% coverage** across the entire solution.
* **Critical Logic**: Aiming for **100% coverage on Domain logic** and scoring algorithms.
