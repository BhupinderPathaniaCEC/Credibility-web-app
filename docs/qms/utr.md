# Unit Test Report (UTR)
# 🧪 Testing Strategy
The Credibility Index project implements a multi-layered testing strategy to ensure reliability and maintainability.

* **Backend Testin**: We utilize xUnit/NUnit for the .NET 10.0 Web API to verify Domain logic and Application use cases.

* **Frontend Testing**: We utilize Karma/Jasmine for the Angular UI components and services to ensure a bug-free user experience.

**Coverage Goals**
We maintain high standards for code quality through strict coverage metrics:

Overall Coverage: Aiming for 80% coverage across the entire solution.

Critical Logic: Aiming for 100% coverage on Domain logic and scoring algorithms.
